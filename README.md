CircleFlow
----------
CircleFlow is a project that revises Coverflow effect. Use Core Animation to build Coverflow-like effect but with a half-circle path.


###How to operate

CircleFlow view will take one swipe at a time to have one page turn. It is not like traditional Coverflow with multiple pages change at once.
